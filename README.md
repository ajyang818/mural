# Mural
A Samsung Smart TV app used to prototype a digital art display for FIELD 3.

## To Do

These are the things we need to work on across the various aspects of Mural. Formatting represents priorities:

> **High** > Medium > *Low* > (Optional) > ~~Just completed~~

### UI
+ **Create "featured works" landing page**
+ Change the "A, B, C, D" buttons
  - either remove entirely or have them point to different browsing panels, e.g. "Artist", "Style", "Custom Search", "Featured"
+ (Splash page at launch)
+ (Piece-specific description/preview page with "Choose" button)

### Content
+ **Create thumbnails for each style of art**, e.g. abstract impressionism, pop art, surrealism
+ *Sample art catalog*
+ ~~Mural logos~~

### Code
+ **Remove superfluous Twitch code, e.g. video/volume controls**
+ **Allow users to sort by artist/contributor**
+ *Search by tag, color*
+ **Clickable thumbnails**
